### About

Motivated by the strong interest among Yale students to build applications, the
Student Developer Program was launched in 2012. The program has three core
goals: provide practical software development experience that is not taught in
the classroom, teach students the software development life-cycle, and engage
the Yale developer community.

We offer students the opportunity to work as Student Developers. Student
Developers receive ongoing training, and get paid to work on software projects
in collaboration with the Yale IT Application Development team.
