### About

Motivated by the strong interest among Yale students to build applications, the Student Developer Program was launched in the Fall of 2012. The program became part of ITS Campus Community Technologies (CCT) in 2014. The program has three core goals: provide practical software development experience that is not taught in the classroom, teach students the software development lifecycle, and engage Yale developer community. 

### Employment & Projects

We offer students the opportunity to work as Student Developers. Student
Developers receive on-going training, and get paid to work on software projects
in collaboration with the ITS Application Development team.

### Community

We also work to support the community of students interested in learning and
practicing software development. In addition to our course offerings, we work
with groups on-campus such as HackYale, Yale BootUp, and the YCC to host events
such as the YCC App Challenge. We also hold open office hours (where students
can drop in to get advice or just chat about building apps), and focus groups
with ITS for students to provide feedback on ITS projects.

### Success

In past years, students who have worked for the Student Developer and Mentorship Program
have gone to intern or work at companies like Bloomberg, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Uber,
and more.
